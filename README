Description:

    In small SOHO / SME environments, proper backup software is not
    always available ("We don't need backups, we have RAID").

    For these environments I use "dump" and "restore" as a first measure
    until proper backups can be configured.

    "dumphost.cron" is a simple script to dump all ext3/ext4 filesystems
    to a network share. The same share (NFS, SMB) can be used by multiple
    hosts; per-host subdirectories are automatically created.

    Backups are taken daily. Full backups are created every Sunday
    morning around 04:00. Supports "Incremental" / "Differential" backups.

    Start of backup is randomly delayed (up to 1 hour) to prevent issues
    in VM environments.

    Dumps for each filesystem are compressed and written to:

        ${DUMPDIR}/${HOSTNAME}/${DATE}-${LEVEL}-${fs_}.dump.gz

    For example:
        /mnt/nas/shared/server01/20120131-0-_.dump.gz
        /mnt/nas/shared/server01/20120131-0-_boot.dump.gz


Preparation:

    Install the "dump" RPM (as root: yum install dump)


Configuration settings in the script:

    1) Change DUMPDIR to point to an NFS (or SMB) share on another server
    or NAS where dumps should be stored. It must be writable by root.

    2) Optional: change LEVEL to Select Incremental or Differential backup
    scheme. Default is Differential (changes since last full backup)


Usage: 

    As root, copy the script to /etc/cron.daily/ (RedHat/CentOS).
    Make sure it is executable (chmod 750 /etc/cron.daily/dumphost.cron)


Restoring data:

    Check 'man restore' for proper syntax. Simple test:

        $ restore -lif /mnt/nas/shared/server01/20120131-0-_.dump.gz
        Dump tape is compressed.
        restore > ls
        .:
        bin/   etc/   lib/   lib64/ opt/   root/  sbin/  tmp/   usr/   var/
        
        restore > quit
